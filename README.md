# Seaborn Python Library

#DataVisualization #Python   

This is a space dedicated to practicing and consolidating my skills in creating engaging and informative statistical visualizations using the Seaborn library with Python.

Here you will find a series of examples and solutions to different data visualization scenarios, ideal for those learning or looking to review key Seaborn concepts. My goal is to explore how Seaborn, built on Matplotlib, simplifies the creation of complex and aesthetically pleasing statistical graphs.

### About this Repository
This repository is the result of following one or more Seaborn tutorials. The exercises are designed to cover a range of features, including:

- Distribution Plots: Histograms, KDE Plots, Displot, Joint Plot, Pair Plot.
- Relationship Plots: Scatter Plots, Line Plots, Rel Plot.
- Categorical Charts: Bar plots, box plots, violin plots, swarm plots, stripplots, catplot.
- Regression Plots: Regplot, lmplot.
- Correlation Matrices and Heatmaps: Heatmaps.
- Customization: Titles, labels, legends, color palettes, predefined styles.
- Facet Grids: Create multiple subplots based on data categories.
- Working with Pandas DataFrames: Seamless integration with data structures.
